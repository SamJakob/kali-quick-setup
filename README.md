Scripts to quickly set up a Kali environment

## Quick note on GPG signatures
I will not be personally enforcing the GPG signing of my commits to this repository as I expect to modify this repository from temporary Virtual Machines, thus **all commits will show up as 'Unverified' in the commit history**.

**This should be fine in this case**, however, as the scripts are intended to be fairly minimal. (...plus you probably ought to check random scripts from the internet before you run them in your machines!)
